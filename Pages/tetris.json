          "text": "I've always enjoyed making games in Desmos, and these are two of my favourite graphs. The first one was made as an exercise to learn Desmos actions, which are a way to update variables automatically, essentially making Desmos a full game engine. I was very proud of my Tetris game, but eventually I felt like I had learnt enough to make a new and improved version. So I have two versions, the first of which is still slighly more performant due to fewer features, but the second one is still much prettier and better in general.\n\nAnother interesting fact: Basically, all Desmos graphs have a link that looks like \"desmos.com/calculator/[hash]\", where the hash is normally a random collection of letters and numbers. But there's a way to set the hash yourself, as long as it's either 10 or 20 characters long. The method is kept somewhat secret to avoid exhausting all the \"good\" hashes, and it's quite an inconvenient process, but I've managed to nab myself the \"tetrisgame\" hash. So [desmos.com/calculator/tetrisgame](https://desmos.com/calculator/tetrisgame) now leads to my tetris game (version 2).\n\nLinks: [Version 1](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/78b054d578)\n[Version 2](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tetrisgame)"
