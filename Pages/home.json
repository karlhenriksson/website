I quite like the style of the website, so I might use it for something else later if I find a good enough reason.\n\nThis website is hosted on GitHub pages. Because GHP doesn't allow server-side logic, I've had to make a slightly dubious workaround to avoid having to write lots of copies of the same HTML code. There's only one HTML document, and the page data is instead stored in JSON files. These files are then requested and handled client-side, rather than constructing everything on the server. Slightly yucky, and certainly slow on a bad connection, but I couldn't come up with a better solution.\n\nIt's still kind of empty, but I'll put stuff here when I feel like it would fit."
